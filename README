This script copies the public vhosts.json file from raven.ukcod.org.uk and
creates an SSH config file to make server connecting easier. It will add
vhost-app and vhost-db entries for every vhost in the data.

If your mySociety username is different to your local username set it in the
MYSOCIETY_USERNAME environment variable before running this script.

Add "Include mysociety_vhosts" to your ~/.ssh/config to include this new file.
